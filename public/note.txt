e.preventDefault(): The e.preventDefault() method is used to prevent the 
default action of an event from being triggered. For example, if you have 
a form on a web page and you want to prevent the form from being submitted 
when the user clicks the submit button, you can use e.preventDefault() 
in the event handler for the form's submit event. This will stop the
 browser's default behavior of sending the form data to the server and 
 reloading the page.
